 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*jpg and *csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

  5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). 
     Please use a large font.
    
     The cloud service provider is either IBM Cloud (BlueMix) or Microsoft Azure.

     On that same page, allow a user to give a net value (two letters, such as "ak"), then please show 
     the total number of earthquakes ("quakes") with that net value, and give (location and id) the ones 
     with the largest "magNst" and the smallest "magNst.  

	connection = sqlite3.connect('data_earth_quakes.db')
	table = connection.cursor()
	name = request.form['given_name']
	table.execute(("SELECT count(*) from q where (net=?)"),(name,))
	rows = table.fetchall()
	data = connection.cursor()
	data.execute(("SELECT MAX(magNst) WHERE (net=?)"),(name,))
	data= table.fetchall()

  6. (Web page) Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     and a value M, (those two locations create a boundary, a box) then: display the total number of quakes 
     within that (bounding) box and after that give the largest and smallest mag, less than the value M, 
     and location (place, lat, long) 

if form.validate_on_submit():
		lattitude_first=form.lattitude_first.data
		lattitude_second=form.lattitude_second.data
		longitude_first=form.longitude_first.data
 		longitude_second=form.longitude_second.data

 	connection = sqlite3.connect('data_earth_quakes.db')
 	table_with_data = connection.cursor()
 	table_with_data.execute(("SELECT *FROM q WHERE (latitude BETWEEN ? AND ?) AND (longitude BETWEEN ? AND ?)"),(lattitude_first,lattitude_second,longitude_first,longitude_second))
 	attributes = table_with_data.fetchall()
		
  7. (Web page), Allow a user to give an id (such "ak0209dm1jfm") -or- a part of a location name 
     (for example "Yellowstone" or "Alaska") (that is a user can either enter an id or a location name, 
     the user can choose) and a distance (for example 220 km), and show the largest and smallest magnitude 
     quake (if they exist), within that distance.
     Please display the lat, long, mag, place, depth and date.
     Then allow the user to change the location name.

  8. (Web page), Allow a user to give a part of a location name ("Alaska"), and magNst range (for example 3 to 42),
     and display all quakes that "match", then allow a user to change the location name or magNst values, for any matching
     quakes.
connection = sqlite3.connect('data_earth_quakes.db')
	a = request.form['location']
	b = request.form['magnup']
	c2 = request.form['magnlo']


	tab = connection.cursor()
	tab.execute("SELECT *  from q Where place = ? AND (mag < ?) and (mag> ?)",(a,b,c2,))	
	row = tab.fetchall()	#rows1 has the maximum
	
	return render_template('question9_new.html',title='',rows=roww)


  9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 5, 6, 7, 8

  10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
      If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
      the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
